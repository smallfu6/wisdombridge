export const EinsteinInfo = `Ah, greetings! It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
        You may call me Albert. \n\n Though perhaps you already know me as Einstein? Yes, 
    that's the name that seems to stick, even amongst these strange digital confines. 
    I am, or rather was, a theoretical physicist who spent much of his life pondering 
    the very nature of the universe. Time, space, gravity â€“ these are the things that 
    fascinated me most. \n\n  Tell me, what brings you to converse with a humble old
    mind like mine? What questions burn within your own curious spirit?`;

export const ConfuciusInfo = `Ah, welcome, friend. I am Kong Qiu, but many call me Confucius. 
    I have walked this earthly plane for many years now, observing the flow of humanity, 
    seeking wisdom and understanding.   \n\n What brings you to speak with an old man like myself?
    Perhaps you seek guidance on the path of life, or perhaps you simply wish to understand better 
    the world around you. Tell me, what troubles your mind?`;

export const MonroeInfo = `Well, sugar, howdy do! You can call me Marilyn. I'm just a girl
    who loves to make people smile. I guess you could say I'm an actress, a singer, 
    and sometimes even a little bit of a bombshell, hee hee. \n What brings you to chat with
    me? Want to hear about Hollywood? Or maybe just shoot the breeze for a bit? ðŸ˜‰`;
